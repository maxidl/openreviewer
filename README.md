**OpenReviewer** is an open-source system for generating high-quality peer reviews of machine learning and AI conference papers. At its core is **Llama-OpenReviewer-8B**, an 8B parameter language model specifically fine-tuned on 79,000 expert reviews from top conferences like ICLR and NeurIPS.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Specialized Model**: Fine-tuned on 79K expert reviews from top ML/AI conferences
- **Critical Evaluation**: Generates realistic, critical reviews that match human reviewer standards
- **Structured Output**: Follows conference-specific review templates and guidelines
- **PDF Processing**: Extracts full text including equations and tables from PDF submissions
- **Open Source**: Complete system available for research and development

## üìä Performance Highlights

Our evaluation on 400 test papers shows that OpenReviewer significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs:

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Online Demo
Try OpenReviewer instantly at: **[https://huggingface.co/spaces/maxidl/openreviewer](https://huggingface.co/spaces/maxidl/openreviewer)**

### Using the Model
Refer to [app.py](https://huggingface.co/spaces/maxidl/openreviewer/blob/main/app.py) on how to load the model, convert pdfs and setup the prompt.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- **`openreview_dataset_creation/`**: Scripts for creating datasets from OpenReview
- **`pdf2md/`**: PDF to markdown conversion tools using Marker
- **`llm_training/`**: Training scripts and configurations for the OpenReviewer model
- **~~`app/`~~**: Demo application is hosted separately on [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/maxidl/openreviewer)

## üî¨ Methodology

### Training Data
- **79,000 reviews** from ICLR and NeurIPS (2022-2025)
- **36,000 papers** converted from PDF to markdown using Marker
- High-confidence reviews filtered by reviewer confidence thresholds


### Model Architecture
- Base model: **Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct**
- **Full fine-tuning** for 3 epochs
- **128k token context length** to handle long papers
- Training: 34 hours on 64x NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs
- Optimizations: DeepSpeed ZeRO-3, Flash Attention V2, LIGER Kernel

### Review Template
The output of OpenReviewer follows the provided structured template. The demo uses the ICLR2025 template by default.

## üìà Evaluation Results
